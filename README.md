# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we will utilize machine learning to predict credit risk. We will build and evaluate models to predict credit risk for Fastlending, a peer to peer lending services company. By using machine learning to predicgt credit risk, we can provide a more reliable loans experience. Machine learning can help to predict good candidates for loans, which in turn will lead to lower default rates.
